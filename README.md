# 1-D Convolution demystified: Illustration on synthetic and practical signals
This a jupyter notebook to describe a tutorial on the topic 1-D convolution of signals. It covers the concept of convolution and how it's applied. Convolution is also applied on some known synthetic signals and practical signals using python. Several applications of 1-D convolution are also mentioned.

Thank you.
