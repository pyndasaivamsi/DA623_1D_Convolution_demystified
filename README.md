# 1-D Convolution demystified: Illustration on synthetic and practical signals
This is a jupyter notebook to describe a tutorial on the topic 1-D convolution of signals. It covers the concept of convolution and how it's applied. Convolution is also applied on some known synthetic signals and practical signals using python. Several applications of 1-D convolution are also mentioned.

1. convolution of two 1-D signals.py - code for convolution of two 1-D arrays.
2. convolution of sinusoid signal.py - code for convolution of a sinusoidal signal with 1-D array.
3. convolution of white noise.py - code for convolution of a white noise signal with 1-D array.
4. convolution of impulse signal.py - code for convolution of an impulse signal with 1-D array.
5. convolution of step signal.py - code for convolution of a step signal with 1-D array.
6. convolution of practical signal.py - code for convolution of a practical signal(model for ECG signal) with 1-D array.

<ins> Note</ins>: 1-D array is chosen for convolution in order to observe how the outputs vary when we change the weights in array and also the variation between input and output when we perform convolution.
